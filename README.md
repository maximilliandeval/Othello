# Othello

This is a text-based version of the classic two-player strategy board game Othello (aka Reversi).  

You can learn the rules of the game here: https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/Othello.pdf.

With this application you can play against another human plauer, or against an AI.

Othello is traditionally played on an 8x8 board, however you have the option to specify a different sized board when the application starts.


I implemented the AI using the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.
